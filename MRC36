# MRC 36 - Contributor's Reward Boost System

## Summary

The MRC 36 - Contributor's Reward Boost System proposes a mechanism to reward code contributors who are willing to commit to the long-term success of the Morpheus project. By allowing contributors to voluntarily block their MOR tokens for a predetermined period, they can receive an increase in the amount of MOR rewarded. This incentivizes long-term commitment and helps stabilize the ecosystem by ensuring that contributors with a vested interest in the project's success are recognized and rewarded proportionally.

## Rationale

This proposal aims to enhance the commitment of Morpheus code contributors by introducing a system that rewards those who demonstrate long-term confidence in the project. 

### Option 1 -  Locking claiming rights:

 - A contributor locks their claim rights for a period of time.
 - This contributor receives additional weights proportional to the time locked.
 - No additional MOR is required. The additional weights just affects the distribution of MOR for the Code group.

#### PROS

 - Few changes are required in the Smart contract. The option to lock claims is already available. The weight system is already in production.

#### Challenges

 - As MOR is no claimable, this cannot be used for staking it as described in MOR22.
 - This can also not be used for doing inferences.

A solution could be simular to the Curve veCRV system. Users could continue using the rights associated to their not claimed MOR but they will not be able to trade them as they cannot claim their MOR til the lock expires.

### Option 2 -  Locking claimed MOR tokens:

 - A contributor claims their tokens
 - Then lock them for a period of time 


## Open Questions

- Should we limit this for the Code group or extend it for other groups?
- What option is more convenient? Is there a bettet third option?


## Value Proposition

The proposed Contributor's Reward Boost System will significantly enhance the value Morpheus provides to its contributors and users. By incentivizing long-term commitment, the system ensures that the most dedicated and confident contributors are rewarded for their loyalty and belief in the project. This leads to a more stable and motivated contributor base, which in turn drives higher quality contributions and continuous improvements to the ecosystem. Additionally, by publicly demonstrating their long-term commitment, contributors can build greater trust within the community, attracting more users and contributors who are aligned with the project's long-term vision. Ultimately, this system strengthens the overall stability and growth potential of the Morpheus ecosystem.

## Dependencies

None.

## New Weights Requested

TBD.

## Existing Weights

None.

## Deliverables

1. Updated Smart Contract: A modified Morpheus Smart Contract that includes the functionality to allow contributors to block their MOR tokens for specified periods and to track these blocks.

2. Weight Calculation Mechanism: A new or enhanced algorithm that accurately calculates and allocates additional weights to contributors based on the amount of MOR blocked and the duration of the block.

3. User Interface Updates: Modifications to the Morpheus user interface to provide contributors with the ability to block their MOR tokens, view their blocked tokens, and see the additional weights they have earned.

4. Documentation: Comprehensive documentation detailing the new system, including guidelines for contributors on how to use the reward boost system, technical documentation for developers, and updates to the existing Morpheus protocol documentation.

5. Testing and Validation: A complete suite of tests to ensure the new features work as intended, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing. Validation of the system's security and reliability will also be conducted.

6. Deployment Plan: A detailed deployment plan outlining the steps to roll out the new features, including a timeline, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies.

## Implementer
